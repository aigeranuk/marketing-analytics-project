**Marketing Campaign Effectiveness Analysis: Methodology and Goals**

This mock dataset has been developed to demonstrate how to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using advanced analytics techniques. The structure and approach are based on real-world use cases and insights gathered from my experience as a Senior Data Analyst.

The primary objective in analyzing marketing effectiveness is to determine which channels perform best in driving conversions. Businesses are typically interested in metrics such as:

* **Conversion Rate**
* **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**
* **Cost per Conversion**

These metrics help inform decisions about budget allocation and strategic focus across marketing channels.

### Analysis Approach

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
   We begin by preparing the dataset for analysis, identifying outliers, inconsistencies, and missing values.

2. **Descriptive Analysis**
   We summarize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average conversion rates and ROAS by channel and customer segment.

3. **Comparative Effectiveness Analysis**
   Using both classical A/B testing and Bayesian A/B testing, we compare the performance of marketing channels across various customer segments to understand statistical significance and probability-based insights.

4. **Campaign-Level Causal Inference**
   Finally, we dive deeper into individual campaigns to assess their lift using causal inference techniques. This helps isolate the actual impact of campaigns from other confounding factors.

Through this layered analysis, we aim to answer critical business questions around which channels and campaigns are truly driving value, and how performance varies by audience segment.
